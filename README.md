# Parcel tracking for desktop

A little desktop app to track your POSTI parcel.
Made with React, Electron and Puppeteer

First run `npm install` to install all the depencies and then you can run the app with `npm run dev`command.

If you don't have a valid tracking id you can type TEST in the text input and it'll simulate how the app should work with a valid tracking id.
