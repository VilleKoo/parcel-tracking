# Parcel tracking for desktop

A little desktop app to track your POSTI parcel.
Made with React, Electron and Puppeteer

You can run the app with **npm run dev** command
or you can build the React app (npm run build) and then just run the desktop app with npm run electron .

If you don't have a valid tracking id you can type TEST in the text input and it'll simulate how the app should work with a valid tracking id.
